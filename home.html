   <p class: step 1> 
    first lets identify the frayed folicals... For instance, for this persons brows, its too long with no 
    straight line. This makes the brows look un-neat. 
    To fix this we use the razor and keep it horizontal against the brows, making sure theres a fixed
    line. (We suggest you keep you natural brows as thick as possible).
     Once its horrizontal 
    press against the brow, this cuts the follicals, giving you the perfect straight line needed to start. Additionally 
    if you can see hair folicals above the cut line, you should use the razor in an angle and shave off the excess hair folicals
    up until the straight line.

<p class:step 3>
once you have the perfect line, you should use the <bold> mini electric shaver</bold> 
and use it at the edges of your brows to give you a perfect crisp ending. Try creating an angled V shape at the edge.
you can either do this using the razor, but id reccomend to do it with the electric shaver.

<p class:step 4>
Finally the last and actually optional step. If you dont have a unibrow, then omit this step,
however for the people who do use <bold> the big electric shaver </bold> for an effortless clean brow.
